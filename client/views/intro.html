    <p>In this HIT, you will take two types of tasks: the first one is a set of controlled tasks where your information will be randomly generated by our system, and we will be able to test “truthfulness” of all the reports. The second one is a simply object recognition task from images where you can form your own belief about the true answer. For instance you may be asked:</p>
    <div id="imageAreaLeft">
      <img src="/images/pairs/1/a.jpg" id="pair-image">
    </div>
    <div id="imageAreaRight">
      <img src="/images/pairs/1/b.jpg" id="pair-image">
    </div>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Are the two birds from different breeds?</span></p>
    <p>You'll receive a base payment of <span style="color:red">$0.25</span> immediately after you complete the entirely HIT. Moreover, you will receive a bonus for each of the tasks you finish (Received within 24 hours). In total, you may expect <span style="color:red">$1</span> payment from participating this HIT.

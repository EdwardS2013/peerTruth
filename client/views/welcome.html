		<h4>This HIT is a study in which we would like to test how people react to a peer evaluation system. The idea is quite simple: when we do not know the ground-truth (the "real answer") to judge your answer fairly, we try to infer it from your peers’ answers. It’s okay if your peers are wrong (in any possible way, even if you don’t trust any of the recruited peers) -- we will be able to figure that out :) A very wrong answer is informative too if you know that it is more likely to be wrong. After all, your answer is as if evaluated against the ground-truth! So we hope this introduce a fair evaluation system for information infusion.</h4>
